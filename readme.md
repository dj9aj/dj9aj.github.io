# My Portfolio Site

[jack-doyle.com](https://www.jack-doyle.com)

I have created a portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. To achieve this, I implemented the following - 



## BEM methodology 
Structured code that's easy to understand and easily scalable



## Sass
Enabled me to break different components down into separate Sass files, with the potential to re-use elements in future projects.



## CSS Grid & Flexbox 
I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. The app is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.



## JavaScript
I created functions to animate the navbar or the section titles, depending on the scroll position on the page.
